# Medical-AI-Chatbot


## Project Overview

The Medical AI Chatbot is an advanced conversational assistant that leverages vision and audio capabilities to provide medical-related information. It integrates Large Language Models (LLM) through the Groq API, speech synthesis using gTTS/Elevenlabs, and a user-friendly interface built with Gradio.

## Features

1. **Conversational AI:** Utilizes Groq API for intelligent and context-aware medical dialogue.

2. **Vision Capabilities:** Processes and analyzes medical images for insights.

3. **Text-to-Speech:** Converts chatbot responses to speech using gTTS or Elevenlabs.

4. **User Interface:** Built using Gradio for an interactive and intuitive experience.

## Tech Stack

1. **Groq API:** For advanced language model capabilities.

2. **gTTS/Elevenlabs:** For text-to-speech conversion.

3. **Gradio:** For building the user interface.

4. **Python:** Core programming language.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
